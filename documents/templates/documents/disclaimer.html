        <h3>Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Taxonomy data: WCSP is the primary source of taxonomy data.
                Other sources such as IPNI, peer reviewed publications, or academic publications are added when a taxon does not exist in WCSP or when there are differences that cannot be rectified.
                All species naming follows International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN).
                The name of species and natural hybrids is uniquely defined by the combination of Genus, species, infraspecific, and author.</li>
            <li>Man-made hybrid name: In OrchidRoots, a man-made hybrid is uniquely defined by their formula and its name follows the International Code of Nomenclature
                for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP).  Our primary source of hybrid is the Royal Horticulture Society registration (RHS).
                In addition, unregistered hybrids are also included in OrchidRoots based on parentage given by users on the condition that the given parentage does not exist or is not a synonym of any
                registered parenage in RHS.</li>
        </ul>
        All data sources are given credit as due.
        In most cases names are displayed with a link to their original source if available.        While we have taken precautions to ensure that the data contained in OrchidRoots website has been obtained from reliable sources
        and is both current and accurate, errors may happen from time to time.

        <ul>
            <li>Species: We seek guidance from our team of curators for photos of orchid species and natural hybrids identification.
                Any photo that has not been verified shall be tagged as "unverified".</li>
            <li>Man-made Hybrid: On the other hand, man-made hybrid is not easy to identify due to the absence of formal description or photos of the original plant registered with the RTS.
                variations of parents used in the crossing and genetic variation among siblings also contribute to the uncertainties.
                These factors added to the identification inaccuracies.  The higher complex a hybrid is, the more difficult it is to identify.
                Therefore all hybrid photos in this website is provided "as-is".  OrchidRoots makes no implications or guarantee about the accuracy or correctness of photo identification.
