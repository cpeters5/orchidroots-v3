Hybrid : tracking ancestor and genetics components of hybridized orchid to make a better decision whether I can grow an orchid plant in my climate.

Taxa rank:
<ul>
    <li>Isonym: When the same name, based on the same type, has been published independently at different times by different authors, then only the earliest of these "isonyms" has nomenclatural status.
The name is always to be cited from its original place of valid publication, and later isonyms may be disregarded.
    </li>
    <li>Basionym is the original name on which a new name is based.  The authors citation of the new name should include the basionym authors in parenthesis. OrchidRoots will ignore basionym and only use the new name.
    </li>


</ul>

<h3>Data Type</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Genus: cit_status is set to the status of citation: illegal (nom. illeg) or rejected (nom. rej) or invalid (nom. invalid).
        If this is the case, the name of the genus name is appended with '-{{cit_status}}'
        Test
    </li>
    <li>Species: Must be a single word. The blank space is reserved for citation status indicator (e.g. name illegal).  The citation status value is set to the status of citation: illegal (nom. illeg) or rejected (nom. rej) or invalid (nom. invalid).
        If citation status has a value, then the name of the genus name is appended to species name separated by a blaqnk space.

    </li>
    <li>
        Kew: TDO. Convert this to a script when ht eprocedure is stable.
        1. If the citation of a species is illegal, invalid or rejected, ... Then assign cit_status to illeg., inval., and rej. respectively and append cit_status value to species name
        2. If a species status is synopnym and its accepted name is "Unplaced Name" then change the status of the species to unplaced and add the species to Accepted
        3. Run updatekewbyyesr.pl.  Output to files
        0. Dont know how to efficiently identify deleted record yet!
        1. newspecies:  Add new species to Species and Accepted (assumed no hybrids, if implementd hybrid, then add to Hybrid)
            2. namechanged.  Reviewed records in Species and change name as indicated.  In case old name has cit_status extension, remove the value from cit_status column first, then make name change, and add value to cit_status.  The cit_status extension in the name change will be done automatically.
                In case the status of citation has changed: if illeg or inval... is added, then update name first, and add new cit_status value afterward. Otherwise, remove ciit_status and make the name change.
            3. status changes:  This is really tedius. You have to check each change record one by one and compare them with Kew database
                Use get_species.sql script.  Create the list of all status changed pids and copy it to line 4 query. Copy the first pid in the list to @a and @b, and to the address of a Kew record.  The refresh Kew.
                If status changed from accepted to synonym
                    1.  Copy the accepted pid to @c and run the script.
                    2.  Change status to synonym in #2 (Species).
                    3.  Start at #10 and work your way back to #3, make correction as appropriated. Delete the changed pid from Accepted (#3)
                If status changed from synonym to accepted (treat unplaced as accepted)
                    1.  Copy pid to @c as well. Run SQL script
                    2.  Change status to accepted in #2 (Species).
                    3.  Add pid to #3 (Accepted)
                    5.  Start at #10 and work your way back to #3, make correction as appropriated.
                    4.  For #6, dheck Kew if there are synonyms, if so add them to #6.  Review each synonym since they may have changed status as well and may be a synonym of some other pid.  If a synonym changed its status, then remove it from hte list in #1.
                Go to the next pid in #1

        Hybrid:
        - If seed or pollen parent is a synonym, then keep the parent's name as is, but put accepted pid as partent's pid.
    </li>
    <li>Suprageneric
        Currently we only record Subfamily, Tribe and Subtribe
    </li>

    <li>
        Clan:  A new classification ranks for genus created to group all species and hybrid that are connected through genealogy.
        Technically a clan is a connected subgraph of the entire geanological graph of orchids.
    </li>
    <li>infrageneric:  We implement infrageneric repository, containing subgenus, section, subsection and series collected from various sources.
    </li>




    <li>Ranking and photo quality: How images are chosen for display in various pages depends on its rank (between 0 to 8) and teh quality attribute of the photo (1=highest, 2 = high, 3 = average and 4 = low).
        <ul>
            <li>Rank 0: Private photos. They are not visible to public.  Only curators and the owner of each photo can them.</li>
            <li>Rank 1: Habitat or in situ photos</li>
            <li>Rank 2: Entire or part of plants</li>
            <li>Rank 3: Inflorescens or long range photos.</li>
            <li>Rank 4: Group of flowers, or part of an inflorescence.</li>
            <li>Rank 5: Protrait of single flower</li>
            <li>Rank 6: (reserved)</li>
            <li>Rank 7: Closeups</li>
            <li>Rank 8: Diagrams, drawings, sections of a flower, or photos that show the size or other descriptive characteristic of the orchid.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>Images displayed in browse genus/browse species are selected randomly from highest quality photos of rank 5, 4 or 8 respectively.
        <br>Images displayed in information page are selected randomly from highest quality photos of rank
        <br>Images displayed in detailed pages are all photos of rank > 0.  Pagionation will be applied if # of photos is greater than 20.
        <br>Images of parentage displayed in detailed pages are selected randomly from trank 8 or 5
        <br>Images in family tree nodes are selected randomly from trank 8 or 5
